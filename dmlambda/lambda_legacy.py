Messages in a dictionary form should adhere to the following spec:
{
    'from': str
    'to': str
    'amount': str, to accommodate different currencies or units
    'date': str right now... needs to be converted to millis, perhaps?
    'subject': str
    ...
}
Messages can hold any EXTRA fields, but most have at LEAST these fields.
For instance,
{
    'aclu_confirmation_code': '12345',
    'from': 'Donald Frump <thefrumpinator@yahoo.net>',
    'to': '"Kayley-anne Conrad's ACLU Campaign" <kayley-anne-conrad-a31c14e59deb@donatemates.com>',
    'amount': '$200.00', 'date': 'Thu, 01 Feb 2015 21:54:02 +0000',
    'subject': 'Fwd: Thank you for your gift to the ACLU'
}
